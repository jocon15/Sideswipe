# Sideswipe

## Overview
Sidswipe is C\++ Testing Framework. It can be used to test C\++ code from a source file or from a compiled library or executable.

I originally wrote this testing framework after having issues with the testing solutions provided by Visual Studio.

I frequently use Sideswipe to test compiled exe applications.

## Bonfire Engine
Sideswipe is built on top of the Bonfire logging system. The Bonfire logging system is a multithreaded queue-based logger. Sideswipe uses Bonfire to generate terminal and file loggs of the test results.
